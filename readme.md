### Lip Reader | Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit (_January 2025)
- Implemented a sentence-level lip-reading system based on the LipNet model, leveraging spatiotemporal convolutional neural networks (STCNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) method for accurate predictions.
- Trained the model end-to-end on the GRID dataset to make character-level predictions, achieving significant accuracy in lip reading tasks.
- Developed the application using Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit, providing an interactive platform to visualize predictions.
- Integrated the lip reading system into a real-time pipeline for accessibility and communication enhancement, reducing dependency on traditional speech recognition systems.
